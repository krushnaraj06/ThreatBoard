   - Ensure file size is under 10MB
   - Verify file structure matches supported formats

2. **No Vulnerabilities Displayed**
   - Check file content and structure
   - Verify CVE IDs are present
   - Ensure severity values are recognized

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Large files may take time to process
   - Use filters to reduce displayed data
   - Consider breaking large files into smaller chunks
